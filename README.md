Updox UI coding challenge
This is a UI coding challenge. This solution utilizes jQuery and DataTables on top of the given JavaScript, HTML, and
CSS to provide the solution. The main.html is the single web page that provides a form to create providers as well as a
table that contains the existing providers. A user may enter a new provider and once submitted, the provider is
prepended into the existing provider table. A user may also check any provider he or she wishes and remove it from the
table as well. The table itself provides a search that updates on each keystroke, sorting (both asc and desc) by
clicking on the heading of the desired column, and a scroll on the right hand side (which also eliminates the need for
pagination).
